# Crop-Prediction-model
  A machine learning–based crop prediction system developed as part of a Design Thinking project. The model predicts the most suitable crop based on soil and environmental parameters, helping support data-driven agricultural decisions. This project demonstrates problem-solving using ML, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.
